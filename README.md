# simpleReact-food-order
During my React js course, I was able to learn core features of React with this project.
And with this project I was able to learn components, props, React hooks, Forms, GET/POST requests in React, and much more. 
Very simple project, in firebase we created back end server which provides us for free and uploaded the list of meals and from there we did GET request 
to receive the meals list. 
User can add meals to cart and user should fill the form of address, street, postal code, etc which then can order.
When order button is clicked we sent the collected data back to backend server.

I deployed this project in Netlify app, you can check it out.
